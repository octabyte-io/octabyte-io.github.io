## Overview

Healthchecks is a comprehensive cron job monitoring solution that listens for HTTP requests and email messages (pings) from your cron jobs and scheduled tasks. If a ping does not arrive on time, Healthchecks immediately sends out alerts, ensuring you never miss critical system operations. It includes a powerful web dashboard, API support, more than 25 integrations for delivering notifications, monthly email reports, and WebAuthn 2FA for enhanced security. With features like team management, projects, team member access control, and read-only access, Healthchecks is ideal for both small teams and large organizations. Additionally, you can choose to self-host the service, customize it to your needs, and integrate it seamlessly into your workflows.

## Features

- ### Live-updating Dashboard

  Healthchecks offers a user-friendly dashboard that displays all your monitored cron jobs, daemons, or scheduled tasks. You can assign names and tags to your checks for easy identification, toggle integrations on/off, and adjust task period and grace time to suit your scheduling needs.

- ### Reliable and Scalable

  The hosted Healthchecks.io service is built on Hetzner bare metal servers with load balancing and backup systems, ensuring high availability and reliability even during traffic spikes. The PostgreSQL database includes a hot standby and encrypted backups to S3, ensuring minimal downtime.

- ### Self-hostable and Open Source

  Healthchecks.io is BSD-licensed and developed openly on GitHub. For users with specific compliance needs or those who wish to customize the service, self-hosting is a flexible option. The open-source code allows for easy extension with proprietary features.

- ### Public Status Badges

  Healthchecks provides status badges for each of your tags, showing the real-time status of your cron jobs. You can display these badges on your project READMEs, dashboards, or status pages with publicly accessible but secure URLs.

- ### Advanced Notifications and Integrations

  With over 25 integrations, Healthchecks supports a wide variety of notification channels, including Slack, email, and more. This ensures that you are instantly alerted via your preferred communication tool when a cron job fails or misses a ping.

- ### WebAuthn 2FA for Enhanced Security

  Protect your Healthchecks account with WebAuthn 2FA, providing an additional layer of security. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the system, safeguarding your cron job monitoring and notifications from unauthorized access.
