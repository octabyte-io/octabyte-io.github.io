## Overview

Coroot is an advanced observability platform that turns your application data—metrics, logs, traces, and profiles—into actionable insights without the need for complex configurations or code changes. By leveraging eBPF technology, Coroot automatically gathers and processes essential performance data, offering a comprehensive service map with 100% coverage of your systems. It helps you monitor application health, track service-level objectives (SLOs), and easily detect and resolve anomalies with minimal effort. Whether you're working with legacy systems or modern cloud-native applications, Coroot provides a unified view of your application's performance, enabling rapid issue resolution and optimized operations.

## Features

- ### Zero-Instrumentation Observability

  Coroot collects metrics, logs, traces, and profiles automatically using eBPF, ensuring seamless observability with no blind spots. It offers a detailed Service Map covering your entire system, accompanied by predefined inspections that audit applications with zero configuration.

- ### Application Health Summary

  With Coroot, you can quickly assess the health of your applications, even when dealing with hundreds of services. The platform provides comprehensive insights into logs and tracks SLOs, so you can effortlessly monitor and maintain the health of your entire infrastructure.

- ### Explore Any Outlier Requests with Distributed Tracing

  Investigate any anomalies or performance issues with just one click using Coroot's distributed tracing capabilities. The vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry instrumentation enables easy tracking of requests across various services, even legacy or third-party applications, without requiring code modifications.

- ### Grasp Insights from Logs with a Quick Glance

  Coroot allows you to quickly identify log patterns through out-of-the-box event clustering. The seamless correlation between logs and traces enables faster troubleshooting, while the lightning-fast search capabilities powered by ClickHouse ensure you never miss critical details.

- ### Seamless Logs-to-Traces Correlation

  Coroot offers integrated logs-to-traces correlation, making it simple to trace issues from logs all the way through to the root cause, eliminating the need for manual tracking and making performance monitoring more efficient.

- ### Lightning-Fast Search Based on ClickHouse

  Experience unparalleled search speed and accuracy with Coroot's use of ClickHouse. This technology ensures that you can quickly retrieve relevant logs and traces to diagnose issues, significantly reducing the time spent troubleshooting and enhancing your system’s overall reliability.
