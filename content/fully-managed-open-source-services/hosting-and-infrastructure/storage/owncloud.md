Whether you are managing personal data, collaborating with a team, or handling sensitive business documents, ownCloud offers a secure platform to store, share, and sync data across multiple devices. With customizable deployment options, including on-premises, at a trusted service provider, or via ownCloud.online (a service hosted in Germany), you can ensure your data remains secure and easily accessible. Built with security at its core, ownCloud uses encryption, multi-factor authentication, and other robust features to give you full control over your data. Boost team productivity with real-time collaboration on documents, file sharing, and much more.
