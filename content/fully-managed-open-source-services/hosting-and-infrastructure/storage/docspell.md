## Overview

Docspell is an open-source document management system designed to streamline the organization of your digital files. Whether your documents come from scanners, emails, or other sources, Docspell provides an efficient and minimal-effort solution for organizing and managing them. It supports a wide variety of file types, extracts text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and offers advanced features such as full-text search and automated document annotations. Docspell's user-friendly interface and powerful tools ensure that you can keep track of your digital documents effortlessly, increasing productivity and reducing the clutter in your digital workspace.

## Features

- ### Text Extraction with OCR

  Docspell utilizes OCR technology powered by Tesseract to extract text from scanned documents and images. This ensures that all your digital documents, including those in image formats, are searchable, making it easy to find relevant content at any time.

- ### Text Analysis

  The extracted text is analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify key properties of your documents. This allows Docspell to automatically annotate your files, helping you categorize and organize your documents with minimal manual effort.

- ### Support for Many File Types

  Docspell supports a wide range of file formats, including ZIP and EML (email file format). It can extract content from these file types and import them into your document management system, ensuring that you can work with all your digital documents in one place.

- ### Conversion to PDF

  Docspell automatically converts all your files into PDF format. It ensures that the original files are preserved and can be downloaded as-is. For image-based documents, such as scanned files, the resulting PDF contains both the image and the extracted text, making it searchable for easy access.

- ### Automated Document Tagging

  Using machine learning, Docspell automatically tags and categorizes your documents based on their content. This helps you stay organized without having to manually sort through each document, saving you time and effort.

- ### Full-Text Search

  With the text extracted from OCR and document analysis, Docspell offers a full-text search functionality. You can quickly locate any document by searching for specific keywords or phrases, making it easier to find the information you need when you need it.
