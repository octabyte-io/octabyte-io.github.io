## Overview

Syncthing is a free, open-source, peer-to-peer file synchronization application that enables seamless synchronization of files across multiple devices. Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD, Syncthing empowers users to sync files both locally and remotely, ensuring efficient real-time transfers. Unlike traditional cloud services, Syncthing never uploads your data, giving you complete control and ensuring your data stays private and secure. Its built-in security features and transparent design guarantee that your files remain protected from unauthorized access while providing a fast and reliable synchronization experience.

## Features

- ### Data Secure

  Syncthing ensures complete privacy by syncing files directly between devices without the need for cloud storage. This peer-to-peer approach guarantees that your data remains under your control and free from third-party interference.

- ### Transparent

  Built on an open and documented protocol, Syncthingâ€™s security mechanisms are visible and defined in the source code. Users can review and understand how data is exchanged, ensuring full transparency in the syncing process.

- ### In Control

  Syncthing puts you in control of your file synchronization. Devices must be added and authorized on both ends before syncing can begin, protecting against unauthorized access, even if one of your devices is compromised.

- ### Rapid Synchronization

  Using a block-based approach, Syncthing segments files into smaller pieces, enabling fast and efficient data transfer across devices. The more devices connected, the faster the synchronization, as data is fetched from multiple devices in parallel.

- ### Cross-Platform Compatibility

  Syncthing works on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD, ensuring you can sync your files across various devices seamlessly.

- ### Offline Synchronization

  Syncthing can sync files even when devices are not connected to the internet, as long as they are on the same local network. This ensures that you can synchronize your files safely and securely, whether you're online or offline.
