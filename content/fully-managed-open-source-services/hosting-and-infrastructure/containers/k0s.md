## Features

- ### Zero Friction

  k0s dramatically reduces the complexity of Kubernetes installation and management. New Kubernetes clusters can be bootstrapped in minutes, and with its user-friendly design, it eliminates the need for specialized knowledge, allowing developers to get started instantly with minimal overhead.

- ### Zero Dependencies

  Distributed as a single binary, k0s requires no additional software or host OS dependencies, except for the OS kernel. This makes it highly portable and ensures that there are no compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, or performance drawbacks that require separate configuration or management.

- ### Zero Cost

  Completely free for both personal and commercial use, k0s is open-source and licensed under the Apache 2 license. Whether you're developing a small app or building enterprise-level solutions, k0s offers a solid foundation for Kubernetes projects without any hidden costs.

- ### Certified Kubernetes Conformance

  k0s is certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), ensuring that it adheres to the highest Kubernetes standards. This means you can deploy workloads with confidence, knowing that k0s is fully compliant with Kubernetes' best practices

- ### Flexible Control Plane

  k0s supports multiple control plane datastores, including in-cluster Elastic Etcd (default), in-cluster SQLite (default for single-node clusters), and external databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, offering flexibility and adaptability for various deployment scenarios.

- ### Seamless Scalability

  Whether running on a single node or at massive scale, k0s is designed for seamless scaling. It ensures that Kubernetes workloads can scale effortlessly without requiring complex configurations, making it ideal for both development environments and large-scale production deployments.
