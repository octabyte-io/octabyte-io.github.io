## Overview

RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher's next-generation Kubernetes distribution built for security, compliance, and efficiency. Designed to meet the stringent requirements of government and enterprise environments, RKE2 includes built-in security mechanisms such as SELinux, AppArmor, and non-root execution to minimize attack surfaces. It is fully conformant with Kubernetes and supports FIPS 140-2 compliance, ensuring high security for sensitive deployments. Additionally, RKE2 is optimized for efficiency, reducing unnecessary dependencies while maintaining full Kubernetes functionality. Its support for air-gapped and offline deployments makes it ideal for government, military, and other highly secure environments. Whether deployed in the cloud, at the edge, or within isolated networks, RKE2 provides a robust and reliable Kubernetes experience.
