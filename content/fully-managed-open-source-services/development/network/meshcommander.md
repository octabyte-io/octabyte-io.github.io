## Overview

MeshCommander is the ultimate open-source management console for Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), designed to simplify remote system administration across multiple platforms. Built entirely in JavaScript, MeshCommander enables IT administrators to manage Intel® AMT-enabled systems through any modern web browser or as a standalone application—without collecting or sending any telemetry data.

Whether you're troubleshooting systems, configuring BIOS remotely, or performing system recovery, MeshCommander gives you full control through features like Hardware KVM, serial-over-LAN access, and remote firmware integration. With its Quick TLS setup, secure management sessions are just two clicks away, making remote IT support seamless, secure, and scalable.

Ideal for enterprises, MSPs, and power users, MeshCommander offers a lightweight, secure, and private alternative to traditional remote management tools—perfect for managing systems over the internet without compromising control or security.

## Features

  Remotely access the desktop and terminal of AMT-enabled systems using built-in KVM and serial-over-LAN tools for troubleshooting and recovery—even when the OS is down.

- ### Quick TLS Setup

  Set up secure TLS connections with just two clicks—no need for external certificate authorities or complex setup procedures.

- ### KVM Session Recording & Playback

  Record entire KVM sessions for training, auditing, or documentation purposes, and replay them directly within the application.

- ### Firmware-Level Integration

  Load MeshCommander directly into Intel AMT firmware (v11.6+), allowing browser-only access without additional software installs.

- ### Cross-Platform & Internet-Ready

  Built in JavaScript for maximum compatibility, MeshCommander works seamlessly across platforms and supports remote management over the internet.

- ### 100% Private & Open Source
