## Overview

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that makes securing your applications and services straightforward. With features like single sign-on (SSO), user federation, social login, and a powerful admin console, Keycloak allows organizations to manage user authentication effortlessly. Whether you're dealing with multiple applications or complex identity providers, Keycloak streamlines the process, ensuring that users can securely access applications without the hassle of managing individual logins.

Keycloak also offers advanced features such as identity brokering and integration with social login services, all configured easily through the admin console. It integrates seamlessly with LDAP, Active Directory, and even relational databases, enabling user federation across different systems. Best of all, Keycloak ensures that administrators have full control over user management, including defining authorization policies and managing user sessions, all from a centralized admin console.

## Features

- ### Single Sign-On/Out

  With Keycloak's single sign-on (SSO), users authenticate once and gain access to all applications integrated with Keycloak. This eliminates the need for multiple logins across different services. Additionally, single sign-out ensures users are logged out from all applications with one action, enhancing security and user experience.

- ### Identity Brokering and Social Login

  Keycloak allows easy integration of third-party social logins (like Google, Facebook, etc.) and identity providers via OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0. By simply configuring the desired provider in the admin console, no changes to the application are necessary, making it simple to implement diverse authentication methods.

- ### User Federation

  Keycloak supports user federation, enabling connection to LDAP, Active Directory, or other external user stores. This allows organizations to centralize their user management without duplicating user accounts across various systems. Custom federated user providers can also be implemented to meet unique organizational needs.

- ### Admin Console

  The Keycloak admin console offers a centralized interface for managing users, roles, applications, and policies. Administrators can configure authentication flows, set up user permissions, manage sessions, and control features like identity brokering and social logins with ease, all from one place.

- ### Fine-Grained Authorization

  Keycloak provides advanced authorization mechanisms, allowing administrators to define fine-grained access control policies for applications and services. This ensures that sensitive resources are securely protected and that users can only access what they are permitted to.

- ### Customizable Authentication Flows

  Keycloak allows you to customize authentication flows, tailoring the user experience to specific organizational requirements. This includes multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, and custom login screens, ensuring flexibility in how users authenticate across your environment.
