## Overview

Parse Server is an open-source backend platform that empowers developers to build applications faster by providing robust features like object and file storage, user authentication, push notifications, and a customizable dashboard. Built on Node.js, Parse Server supports MongoDB and PostgreSQL as its database options, offering flexibility for various project needs. You can deploy and run Parse Server on any infrastructure compatible with Node.js, giving you complete control over your backend. Developers can locally test and iterate on their applications without relying on cloud deployment, ensuring a seamless development experience. Whether you’re a solo developer or managing enterprise-level applications, Parse Server simplifies backend operations, accelerates development, and delivers a scalable solution for modern applications.

## Features
