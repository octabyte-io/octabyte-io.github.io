## Overview

Appsmith is a leading low-code, open-source framework designed to simplify the process of building internal applications. With a JavaScript-based visual development platform, you can rapidly create CRUD apps, dashboards, admin panels, and more. Leverage pre-built UI components and connect them to your APIs and databases to develop dynamic apps and complex workflows. Deploy these applications on your preferred technology stack, whether it's cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Appsmith supports a wide range of databases and APIs, enabling seamless integration and scalability for internal business needs.
