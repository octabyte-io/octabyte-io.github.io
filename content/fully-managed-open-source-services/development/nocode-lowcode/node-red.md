## Overview

Node-RED is a powerful open-source visual programming tool that simplifies the integration of hardware devices, APIs, and online services. It allows users to create interactive flows using a browser-based editor, making it easier than ever to wire together complex systems and automate processes. Built on Node.js, Node-RED takes advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model, making it suitable for both low-cost hardware, like Raspberry Pi, and cloud-based applications. With an extensive library of nodes and modules, Node-RED enables seamless connectivity and automation across a wide range of technologies, from IoT devices to cloud services.

## Features

- ### Browser-based Flow Editing

  Node-RED provides a simple and intuitive browser-based editor that enables users to create and edit flows effortlessly. With a variety of nodes available, you can wire your devices, APIs, and services together visually. Deploying changes is as simple as a single click.

- ### Built on Node.js

  The Node-RED runtime is built on Node.js, which leverages the power of its event-driven, non-blocking architecture. This makes it perfect for edge computing on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi or for cloud-based deployments, allowing for fast and efficient processing.

- ### Social Development

  Node-RED supports collaborative development through its JSON-based flow storage, enabling easy import/export of flows. The platform includes an online flow library where users can share their creations, helping others to easily reuse and build upon existing workflows.

- ### Runs on Low-Cost Hardware

  Due to its lightweight and event-driven architecture, Node-RED is ideal for running on budget-friendly hardware like Raspberry Pi. It allows users to integrate hardware and cloud-based services without the need for expensive infrastructure.

- ### Extensive Node Library

  Node-RED comes with an extensive library of pre-built nodes for various services and devices. Whether you are connecting IoT sensors, APIs, or cloud services, youâ€™ll find a node to meet your needs. You can also create custom nodes to further extend its functionality.

- ### Real-Time Data Processing

  Node-RED excels in real-time data processing, making it an ideal choice for applications that require quick, event-driven responses. With its non-blocking nature, you can process large amounts of data without delays, ensuring seamless operation even in resource-constrained environments.
