## Overview

ToolJet is an open-source platform designed to help developers create internal tools in minutes. By seamlessly integrating with various databases, cloud services, and custom APIs, ToolJet allows you to fetch data and take actions effortlessly. With its intuitive visual builder, you can quickly design applications using pre-built components like tables, charts, maps, buttons, and more. For advanced customizations, ToolJet supports JavaScript, enabling you to write custom code almost anywhere within the builder. Whether youâ€™re building simple tools or complex applications, ToolJet provides the flexibility and power you need to accelerate development.

## Features

- ### Open-Source

  ToolJet is fully open-source, built with JavaScript (NestJS + ReactJS), allowing developers to fork, extend, and contribute to the project. If you encounter bugs, you can easily report issues or submit pull requests on GitHub to improve the platform.

- ### Write Custom JS Code

  With ToolJet, you can inject custom JavaScript code almost anywhere within the visual editor. The platform offers a helpful code suggestions dropdown, allowing you to easily include dynamic variables in your code as you type, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of your internal tools.

- ### Preview Queries

  ToolJet enables you to run queries directly from the editor. You can preview query results in real time, with the dependent components automatically refreshing to display the latest data. This ensures smooth and dynamic user interfaces for your internal tools.

- ### State Inspector

  The built-in state inspector in ToolJet allows you to easily monitor the current state of queries and components. This feature provides valuable insights into your application's behavior, making debugging and optimization more efficient.

- ### Pre-built Components

  ToolJet comes with a wide array of pre-built components, such as tables, charts, maps, buttons, and more. These components can be customized and connected to data sources, enabling you to rapidly build complex applications without needing to start from scratch.

- ### Seamless API Integration

  Connecting ToolJet to custom APIs is a breeze. You can fetch data, trigger actions, and manage workflows between your internal tools and external systems, all from within the visual builder. This deep integration empowers your tools to interact with various services, cloud platforms, and databases.
