## Overview

TotaljsFlow is a powerful, modern visual programming tool that simplifies low-code development. Designed for developers and non-developers alike, it provides a user-friendly interface to build complex workflows and integrate various data sources effortlessly. Accessible through a web browser, TotaljsFlow allows you to create, modify, and deploy real-time event-driven applications without writing extensive code. By using components, workers, and a message service, TotaljsFlow enables seamless integration and real-time data processing. Whether you're building automation systems, IoT applications, or data pipelines, TotaljsFlow is a versatile platform that accelerates development while reducing the complexity of traditional coding.

## Features

- ### Component's Editor

  Create and modify Total.js Flow components in real-time directly within the flow interface. The editor also allows seamless editing of imported components, making it easy to customize and enhance your projects dynamically.

- ### Worker-Thread

  Each flow in TotaljsFlow runs independently in a child process (worker-thread), separate from the main thread. This architecture ensures enhanced performance and memory efficiency, with each worker thread consuming around 5-15 MB of RAM.

- ### Total.js Message Service

  TotaljsFlow integrates seamlessly with the Total.js Message Service, enabling efficient communication through PUB/SUB and RPC architecture. This feature allows you to easily connect multiple Total.js applications, facilitating smooth data exchange.

- ### Real-Time Traffic Indicator

  Monitor the data flow in real-time with the built-in traffic indicator. It displays the real-time input and output data of each component, allowing you to track and optimize data processing instantly.

- ### Drag-and-Drop Interface

  TotaljsFlow features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that enables users to quickly build and modify their workflows without the need for extensive coding. This feature speeds up development and makes it accessible for users of all skill levels.

- ### Integrated Debugging Tools

  The platform includes built-in debugging tools that allow users to test, troubleshoot, and refine their flows. With real-time logs and error tracing, you can quickly identify issues and enhance the reliability of your application.
