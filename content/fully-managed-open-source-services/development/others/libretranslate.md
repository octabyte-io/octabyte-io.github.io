## Overview

LibreTranslate is a powerful, open-source machine translation API that offers completely self-hosted translation services, ensuring that your data is always private. Unlike other APIs that depend on proprietary translation engines like Google Translate or Microsoft Azure, LibreTranslate is powered by the open-source Argos Translate library. This unique approach allows users to perform translations without any usage fees, data sharing, or reliance on third-party providers. Supporting 29 languages, LibreTranslate provides seamless integration with your own software through a REST API, making it an ideal solution for developers and businesses looking for a cost-effective and secure translation service.
