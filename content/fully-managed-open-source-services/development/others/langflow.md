## Overview

Langflow is an open-source, Python-powered visual framework designed to revolutionize AI development. It enables users to build and experiment with multi-agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, offering a highly customizable and flexible environment. Langflow stands out with its model-agnostic nature, allowing seamless integration with various machine learning models and vector stores. Whether you're an AI developer or a researcher, Langflow redefines how you approach AI experimentation, providing an intuitive interface to streamline workflows and unlock new possibilities in real-world applications.

## Features

- ### Prompt Variables

  Langflow introduces dynamic inputs using curly brackets {}, allowing you to easily customize prompts and manage variables on the fly. This flexibility enables users to fine-tune their AI models for specific use cases.

- ### Fine-Tuning

  Harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Langflowâ€™s built-in fine-tuning capabilities. Fine-tune models effortlessly using data from spreadsheets, ensuring your AI adapts to unique requirements and improves over time.

- ### Group Components

  Langflow makes it easy to build higher-level components from basic AI building blocks. Once created, these components can be stored, reused, and shared with others, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

- ### Custom Components

  For more advanced users, Langflow offers the ability to code and integrate custom components. This feature provides the freedom to go beyond pre-built tools and create tailored solutions that suit your specific needs.

- ### Model and Vector Store Agnostic

  Langflow is designed to work seamlessly with any model or vector store, making it incredibly flexible and adaptable to a variety of use cases. You are not restricted to a specific ecosystem and can integrate any technology that fits your project.

- ### Intuitive User Interface

  Langflow features an intuitive, visual interface that allows you to design, test, and deploy AI systems without writing extensive code. This simplicity ensures that developers and researchers alike can focus on innovation rather than technical hurdles.
