## Overview

Presidio is a powerful open-source framework designed to help organizations safeguard sensitive data by detecting and anonymizing personally identifiable information (PII) across various formats, including text, images, and structured datasets. Built with privacy and flexibility in mind, Presidio supports both predefined and custom PII recognizers using natural language processing (NLP), regular expressions, rule-based logic, and checksums.

Its modular architecture allows seamless integration with external PII detection models, while supporting multiple deployment options—from Python scripts and PySpark jobs to containerized environments like Docker and Kubernetes. With robust customization features, Presidio lets developers tailor recognition and anonymization workflows to meet industry-specific compliance and privacy needs.

Whether you're looking to secure customer data, anonymize documents for machine learning, or comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, Presidio provides a scalable and developer-friendly solution for PII protection.
