Built on the widely-used Chart.js library, QuickChart offers a fast and efficient way to create charts that can be easily embedded in non-dynamic environments like emails, chatrooms, and SMS. Whether you’re a developer looking for a versatile tool to integrate with your application or a user looking for a no-code solution, QuickChart provides a seamless way to visualize data in image format. With its easy-to-use features, open-source nature, and scalability, QuickChart is the ideal choice for anyone needing dynamic, yet static, chart images.

## Features

- ### Hosted Solutions

  Rendering charts at scale can be resource-intensive, but QuickChart handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on building your app. By purchasing a license, you gain permission to modify QuickChart for private, on-premise, and commercial use.

- ### Charts Anywhere

  With QuickChart, charts are defined by their URL, making it easy to use the API across different programming languages. Since the API generates image-based charts, you can embed them anywhere, from emails to websites.

- ### No-Code Chart Maker

  QuickChart's no-code chart maker allows users to create custom chart templates without coding. These templates can be embedded in no-code platforms like Airtable, Bubble, and AppSheet, making chart creation accessible to everyone.

- ### Open-Source

  QuickChart is open-source and dual-licensed under the GNU GPLv3 and a commercial license. This allows users to modify the code as needed and integrate the charts into any application without worrying about proprietary restrictions.

- ### Customizable Chart Templates

  With QuickChart, you can create custom chart templates tailored to your needs. Whether you need bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs, QuickChart’s flexibility lets you design charts to suit your project.

- ### Scalable and Reliable

  QuickChart is built for scale, ensuring that you can generate thousands of charts per minute. Whether you are running a small project or need to render data for large-scale applications, QuickChart provides the reliability and performance you need.
