## Features

- ### Diagram Wherever You Want

  Use any cloud platform of your choice—Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, GitHub/GitLab, or even store diagrams directly in your browser or on your device. This flexibility allows you to choose the most convenient option for storing and sharing your diagrams.

- ### Integrate Diagrams with Other Software

  Draw.io integrates seamlessly with Atlassian Confluence and Jira, allowing users to store and manage their diagrams within these platforms. Collaborators don’t need to create accounts or worry about file format conversion to view or edit shared diagrams.

- ### Collaborate in Real-Time with Shared Cursors

  Collaborating on diagrams is made easy with real-time synchronization. Multiple editors can make changes simultaneously, and the shared cursor feature ensures everyone stays on the same page, whether using Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, or Confluence.

- ### Create a Wide Range of Diagrams

  Draw.io offers a comprehensive set of shape libraries for creating any type of diagram you need, from flowcharts and mind maps to complex technical diagrams like network infrastructures or UML diagrams.

- ### No Account Needed for External Collaboration

  Share your diagrams with anyone, even if they don’t have a Draw.io account. The online editor allows external collaborators to edit and view diagrams without any registration, simplifying the process and fostering easier collaboration.

- ### Browser-Based Editor for Ultimate Accessibility

  With its browser-based editor, Draw.io can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need for installation or setup. This feature ensures your diagrams are always available on-the-go, with no barriers to access.
