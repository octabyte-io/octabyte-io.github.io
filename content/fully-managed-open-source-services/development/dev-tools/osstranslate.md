## Overview

OSSTranslate is a powerful, self-hosted, and open-source machine translation API designed for developers, businesses, and privacy-conscious users. Unlike commercial translation APIs like Google Translate or Microsoft Azure, OSSTranslate operates entirely within your infrastructure using the Argos Translate engine. This ensures complete control over your data and removes reliance on third-party cloud providers.

Proudly built from LibreTranslate’s open-source project, OSSTranslate by OctaByte is not affiliated with LibreTranslate, but extends its capabilities by offering a ready-to-deploy, private solution for machine translation.

With support for over 29 languages and a fully documented REST API, OSSTranslate enables seamless integration into your applications, tools, and platforms—without sacrificing privacy, performance, or cost.

Whether you’re building multilingual websites, translating user-generated content, or powering communication tools, OSSTranslate is your go-to alternative to proprietary machine translation services.
