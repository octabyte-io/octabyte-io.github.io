## Overview

GrowthBook is an innovative, open-source platform designed to streamline the deployment process with feature flags and A/B tests. It helps teams make data-driven decisions by offering powerful tools for experimenting, testing, and rolling out features with precision. GrowthBook promotes feature flagging as a critical part of the development cycle and allows organizations to test, analyze, and gradually roll out new features without interrupting user experience.

This platform provides a flexible solution, whether used as a full-stack platform, a plugin for feature flagging, or a sophisticated analysis engine. GrowthBook integrates seamlessly with existing data stacks like BigQuery, Mixpanel, and Redshift, making it easy to track and measure experiments. With advanced testing methods, such as CUPED, Bayesian analysis, and sequential testing, GrowthBook helps teams unlock deeper insights from their A/B tests to optimize user engagement and performance.

## Features

- ### Feature Flags

  Implement feature flags with advanced targeting, gradual rollouts, and A/B testing capabilities to control the visibility of new features, ensuring seamless user experiences.
