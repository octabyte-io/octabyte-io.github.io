## Overview

Cronicle is a powerful and flexible task scheduler designed for modern server environments. Unlike traditional cron jobs, Cronicle supports both scheduled and on-demand tasks, allowing you to automate processes across multiple servers with ease. This open-source tool is built in Node.js and provides a sleek, web-based front-end UI for easy management. Cronicle offers features like automatic server discovery, failover support, and real-time job stats. With no need for a database, Cronicle is simple to set up, offering storage via JSON files. Whether you need recurring or one-time tasks, Cronicle helps you manage workloads efficiently, making it an ideal replacement for Cron in complex server setups.

## Features

- ### Single or Multi-Server Setup

  Cronicle allows for auto-discovery of nearby servers and supports multi-server setups. It features automatic failover to backup servers, ensuring jobs are reliably retried when necessary, even if a server goes down.

- ### No Database Required

  Cronicle does not require any database to function. All job configurations, logs, and stats are stored as simple JSON files on disk, reducing overhead and simplifying setup.

- ### Visual Date/Time Picker

  The intuitive visual date/time picker makes scheduling easy. Events can be set to run at specific times or on recurring schedules—hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly—without needing complex commands.

- ### Real-Time Stats & Live Log View

  Monitor job progress in real-time with graphical progress bars and estimated completion times. The live log viewer offers instant updates on job execution, providing transparency and quick troubleshooting.

- ### Extensible Plugin Support

  Cronicle supports custom plugins written in virtually any programming language. Extend its functionality to meet your specific needs, integrating with other tools or systems in your workflow.

- ### Job Dependency Management

  Manage complex job chains by defining dependencies. Cronicle allows jobs to trigger other jobs based on success or failure, automating workflows and reducing manual intervention.
