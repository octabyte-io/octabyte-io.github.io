## Features

- ### Live-updating Dashboard

  Healthchecks provides a dynamic, real-time dashboard where you can view all your monitored checks. Customize the dashboard by giving each check a name and assigning tags for easy identification. Toggle integrations, adjust task periods, and grace times to tailor the dashboard to your needs.

- ### Reliable Performance

  The hosted Healthchecks.io service ensures high reliability with Hetzner's bare-metal servers. With load balancing and hot standby PostgreSQL databases, Healthchecks guarantees stability even during traffic spikes. Daily encrypted backups to S3 ensure data safety.

- ### Self-hostable Option

  For users who prefer complete control, Healthchecks is BSD-licensed and open-source. Self-hosting is an ideal solution for adding proprietary features or meeting compliance requirements, allowing you to deploy Healthchecks on your own infrastructure and customize it as needed.

- ### Public Status Badges

  Healthchecks provides public status badges for each of your checks. These badges can be integrated into your README files, status pages, or dashboards, offering a quick and visible way to communicate the status of your checks to stakeholders.
