## Overview

Imagor is a powerful and efficient Go-based image processing tool designed to handle high-concurrency image transformations for web applications. With its seamless support for the Thumbor URL syntax, Imagor provides a robust solution for image loading, processing, and storage, making it the ideal choice for developers looking for a lightweight, fast, and scalable image processing tool. It is optimized for Unix environments and can be easily containerized using Docker. Imagor supports a variety of image processing use cases, including resizing, cropping, and format conversion, all while maintaining high performance under heavy traffic loads. Whether you're working with static images, dynamic image processing, or cloud storage, Imagor is a versatile tool that can be easily integrated into your web application to enhance user experience and performance.

## Features

- ### Loader

  Imagor's Loader efficiently loads images from various sources, enabling easy integration with web applications without modifying static directories. Whether your images are hosted locally or remotely, Imagor's Loader ensures quick and seamless access to them.

- ### Storage

  The Storage feature allows Imagor to load and save images, ensuring that subsequent requests for the same image are served directly from storage, reducing unnecessary HTTP requests and improving performance.

- ### Result Storage

  Result Storage saves processed images for future requests, allowing Imagor to serve the same processed image without redoing the transformation. This saves processing resources and improves response time for repeated requests.

- ### HTTP Loader

  Imagor includes built-in adaptors that support multiple image loading sources, including HTTP, proxy, file systems, and AWS S3. By default, the HTTP Loader is used as the fallback method, ensuring flexibility in how images are loaded.

- ### Docker-Ready

  Imagor is designed to be easily containerized using Docker, allowing seamless deployment across different environments. This makes it a perfect choice for cloud-native applications and scaling with containerized infrastructures.

- ### Thumbor URL Syntax Compatibility

  Imagor adopts the Thumbor URL syntax, making it a drop-in replacement for existing Thumbor-based image processing setups. This ensures compatibility with your existing image processing pipelines while offering superior performance and scalability.
