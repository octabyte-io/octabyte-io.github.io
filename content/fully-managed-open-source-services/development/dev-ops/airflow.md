## Overview

Apache Airflow is a leading open-source platform designed for workflow automation and orchestration. By defining workflows as code, Airflow ensures they are maintainable, versionable, and testable. Its Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) enable users to organize complex workflows into manageable tasks. The powerful scheduler executes tasks based on dependencies, providing a seamless way to manage pipelines.

With its rich user interface, you can visualize running pipelines, track progress, and troubleshoot with ease. The platform supports robust integrations with major cloud providers and third-party tools, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases, including data engineering, machine learning, and infrastructure management. Airflow empowers teams to focus on productivity while reducing the complexity of managing workflows.
