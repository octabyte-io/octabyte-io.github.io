## Overview

K3s is a streamlined, lightweight Kubernetes distribution that simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters in resource-constrained environments. With a focus on edge, ARM, IoT, and CI workloads, K3s is the ideal solution for remote locations, low-resource systems, and continuous integration pipelines. It delivers the full power of Kubernetes with minimal overhead, making it the perfect choice for developers and enterprises seeking a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional Kubernetes setups.

K3s is packaged as a single binary under 100MB, significantly reducing complexity and installation time. Its design eliminates the need for heavy dependencies, ensuring that it can run on a wide range of hardware from small Raspberry Pi devices to large-scale cloud infrastructure. With built-in features like service load balancing, Helm controller, and Traefik ingress, K3s is ready for production use in edge environments and IoT devices.

## Features

- ### Perfect for Edge

  K3s is designed for highly available, production-grade Kubernetes workloads in edge environments. It excels in resource-constrained, remote locations or IoT appliances, providing seamless, secure, and scalable Kubernetes clusters even in the most challenging setups.

- ### Simplified & Secure

  The single <50MB binary of K3s reduces the need for complex dependencies, making installation, running, and auto-updating Kubernetes clusters simpler and more secure. This minimalistic approach ensures that K3s can be quickly deployed with fewer steps and less overhead.

- ### Optimized for ARM

  K3s is fully optimized for ARM architectures, including ARM64 and ARMv7. Whether you're running on a Raspberry Pi or a large AWS instance, K3s provides support for a wide range of ARM-based devices, ensuring efficient resource usage and high performance.

- ### Batteries Included

  K3s comes with essential features out of the box, including a local storage provider, service load balancer, Helm controller, and the Traefik ingress controller. These features are pre-configured, saving you time and effort in setting up additional components for your Kubernetes cluster.

- ### Resource-Efficient

  K3s is lightweight, making it the perfect choice for environments with limited resources. Its minimal footprint allows Kubernetes clusters to run efficiently on devices with low memory and CPU, such as Raspberry Pi and other edge devices.

- ### Ideal for CI/CD Workflows

  K3s is optimized for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, providing a scalable and easy-to-manage Kubernetes solution for automating testing, building, and deploying applications across various environments with minimal overhead.
