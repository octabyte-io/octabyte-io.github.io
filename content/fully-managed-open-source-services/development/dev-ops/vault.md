## Overview

Vault is an advanced open-source tool designed to help organizations securely manage secrets like API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. It provides a unified interface to access and manage secrets with strict access control and comprehensive audit logging. Vault empowers developers and security teams to seamlessly integrate secret management into their workflows, ensuring a robust layer of data security. With features like secure secret storage, dynamic secret generation, and data encryption, Vault simplifies the complexities of safeguarding sensitive information. Whether you’re managing cloud credentials or encrypting data, Vault offers unparalleled flexibility and reliability.

## Features

- ### Secure Secret Storage

  Store arbitrary key/value secrets with unmatched security. Vault encrypts secrets before storing them, ensuring raw storage access doesn’t compromise your sensitive data.

- ### Dynamic Secrets Generation

  Generate on-demand secrets for systems like AWS or SQL databases. Vault dynamically creates unique secrets, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.

- ### Data Encryption

  Leverage Vault to encrypt and decrypt data without saving it. This feature lets teams define encryption parameters while storing encrypted data securely in databases or other systems.

- ### Leasing and Renewal

  Automate the lifecycle of secrets with leasing. Vault associates a lease with every secret, automatically revoking them upon expiry, while enabling lease renewal through APIs.

- ### Comprehensive Audit Logging

  Keep track of all secret access and management activities. Vault maintains a detailed audit log, offering visibility and accountability for your sensitive data operations.

- ### Access Control Enforcement

  Ensure only authorized personnel can access secrets. Vault’s granular access controls allow organizations to enforce security policies tailored to specific roles and permissions.
