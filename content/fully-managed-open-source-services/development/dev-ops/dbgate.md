It is available for Windows, Linux, Mac, or can be used as a web application, providing seamless support for database connections across different platforms.

Whether you're working with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis, DbGate offers a user-friendly interface and robust features. It supports connection via SSH tunnel, making it ideal for accessing production databases behind firewalls. With its advanced data editor, users can quickly navigate complex relations and make necessary modifications with ease.

This versatile tool is perfect for database administrators, developers, and anyone working with databases, providing both convenience and power to streamline workflow.

## Features

- ### DB Connections

  DbGate supports seamless connections to a variety of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server (with Windows authentication), MongoDB, SQLite, Amazon Redshift, CockroachDB, and even Oracle (experimental). It also allows connections over an SSH tunnel, enabling secure access to production databases behind firewalls.

- ### Data Editor

  DbGate's data browser and editor provide an efficient way to navigate and modify complex data relationships. With this feature, you can quickly find and edit data, which is more efficient than writing queries manually. It supports multiple methods of interaction, such as query designers and direct editing.

- ### Export and Import

  DbGate supports a wide range of import/export formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, and more. It also allows users to extend formats through plugins and includes support for scripting with JavaScript, offering flexibility in automating data transfers.

- ### NoSQL Database Support

  DbGate excels in NoSQL database management with native support for MongoDB and Redis. Unlike other database tools that limit MongoDB to table-like views, DbGate uses a native MongoDB driver, allowing for more efficient and flexible interaction with the database.
