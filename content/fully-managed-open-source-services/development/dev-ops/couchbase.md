## Overview

Couchbase is a modern cloud-native, distributed database designed to meet the evolving demands of today's data-driven applications. It combines the strengths of traditional relational databases, such as SQL and ACID transactions, with the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL through JSON support. This hybrid approach ensures developers can build robust, scalable, and highly available applications.

With Couchbase, developers can query and manipulate JSON data using SQL++, a powerful declarative language. Couchbase simplifies complex database operations with features like ACID transactions for multi-document atomicity, real-time event-driven logic with Eventing, and advanced analytics powered by a massively parallel processing (MPP) query engine. Available as a service on commercial clouds and compatible with hybrid and private cloud environments, Couchbase is the ideal solution for organizations seeking speed, reliability, and adaptability in their data infrastructure.

## Features

- ### SQL++ Queries

  Couchbase empowers developers with SQL++, an expressive and comprehensive declarative language for querying and transforming JSON data. This powerful language bridges the gap between relational databases and NoSQL, making it easier to build and maintain modern applications.

- ### ACID Transactions

  Achieve multi-document atomicity and durability for scalable applications without compromising reliability. Couchbase handles transactional complexity, enabling developers to focus on building high-performing, dependable systems.

- ### Real-Time Eventing

  Couchbase Eventing lets you define and execute custom business logic in real-time. Trigger server-side actions instantly when application interactions modify data, enabling dynamic and responsive workflows.

- ### Advanced Analytics

  Perform ad hoc analytical queries on operational data using a high-performance MPP query engine. Couchbase ensures workload isolation to deliver insights without impacting application performance.

- ### Cloud-Native Architecture

  Deploy Couchbase seamlessly across commercial clouds, hybrid setups, or private environments. Its cloud-native design ensures high availability, elasticity, and cost-efficiency, catering to diverse deployment needs.

- ### JSON Flexibility at Scale

  Leverage the power of JSON to build dynamic, schema-less applications that scale effortlessly. Couchbase combines NoSQL's flexibility with relational databases' structure, offering unparalleled adaptability.
