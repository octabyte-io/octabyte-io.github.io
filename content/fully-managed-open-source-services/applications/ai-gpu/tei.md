## Overview

TEI (Text Embeddings Inference) is an open-source, blazing-fast inference solution designed specifically for generating text embeddings with unmatched performance and efficiency. Built for real-time and production environments, TEI benchmarks impressively on models like BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, achieving exceptional speeds on GPUs such as the Nvidia A10 with sequences up to 512 tokens.

Under the hood, TEI employs advanced technologies like Flash Attention, Candle, and cuBLASLt to power its inference engine. It dynamically adapts to workloads through token-based batching, reducing latency and maximizing GPU utilization. With support for Safetensors weight loading, TEI significantly improves initialization times, ensuring rapid deployment.

TEI is also engineered for scalable, observable, and production-grade usage. It includes built-in support for distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry and exposes Prometheus metrics for effortless monitoring. Whether you're building AI-powered applications, search engines, or NLP pipelines, TEI offers the speed, efficiency, and reliability needed to run large-scale inference workloads.

## Features

- ### Dynamic Batching

  TEI utilizes token-based dynamic batching to intelligently manage GPU resources and minimize idle time, leading to improved inference throughput.

- ### Optimized Inference Engine

  Built using cutting-edge components like Flash Attention, Candle, and cuBLASLt, TEI ensures highly optimized transformer model execution with minimal latency.

- ### Fast Model Loading with Safetensors

  TEI supports Safetensors weight loading for dramatically faster startup times, enabling rapid scaling and reloading of models in production.

- ### Production-Grade Observability

  Integrated with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and Prometheus for metrics export, TEI is fully equipped for monitoring and diagnostics in real-world deployments.

- ### High Performance on Modern GPUs

  TEI is benchmarked on advanced GPUs like the Nvidia A10, delivering low-latency inference even with long sequences of up to 512 tokens.

- ### Open Source and Extensible

  As an open-source solution, TEI is customizable and extendable to fit specific NLP workflows, making it an ideal choice for developers and ML engineers.
