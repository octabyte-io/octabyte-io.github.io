## Overview

Umami is a straightforward and user-friendly web analytics platform designed to give you a privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics and other paid analytics services.

The interface is simple, presenting all data on a single page, so you don’t have to dig through complicated reports. Hosted on your own server, Umami ensures you have full control over your data and avoids the privacy issues associated with third-party tracking systems.
