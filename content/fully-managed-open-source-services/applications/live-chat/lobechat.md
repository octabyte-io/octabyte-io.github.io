  With built-in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities, LobeChat allows users to communicate with the chatbot using voice. Choose from a variety of voice options to enhance the natural interaction experience.

- ### Text to Image

  Leverage the power of AI-driven image generation tools like DALL-E 3, MidJourney, and Pollinations to create images directly within the chat. LobeChat transforms your textual input into high-quality visual content, enriching your conversational experience.

- ### Function Calling Plugin System

  LobeChat's plugin system enhances the core functionality by enabling real-time information retrieval and processing. Plugins can fetch news headlines, access e-commerce platforms, retrieve documents, and much more, providing dynamic and immediate responses during conversations.
