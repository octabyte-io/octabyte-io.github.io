## Overview

Jibri (Jitsi Broadcasting Infrastructure) is a powerful open-source tool that enables the recording and live streaming of Jitsi Meet video conferences. Designed to run on a separate server, Jibri works by launching a headless Chrome instance that captures your meetings and encodes them using ffmpeg. Whether you're looking to save important discussions for later or broadcast events in real-time to services like YouTube or Facebook Live, Jibri makes it effortless.

By integrating Jibri with your Jitsi Meet deployment, you gain complete control over content distribution and archival. The tool offers high-quality audio and video capture, reliable performance, and smooth integration, making it ideal for webinars, team meetings, online classes, and more.
