## Overview

Yopass is a cutting-edge encryption tool that ensures the highest level of privacy for file and message sharing. Built on open-source software, Yopass offers full transparency, allowing anyone to audit and contribute features. With a focus on security, Yopass encrypts messages and files locally in the browser, ensuring that sensitive data is never stored in untrusted servers. The self-destruction feature ensures that files and messages are automatically deleted after a set time, reducing the risk of long-term data exposure. Yopass also includes one-time download functionality, which prevents unauthorized access by ensuring files are only accessible once. Whether you are sharing personal or professional data, Yopass guarantees your files remain private and secure.

## Features

- ### End-to-End Encryption

  Yopass ensures that encryption and decryption occur directly in your browser. The encryption key is never stored on external servers, keeping your messages and files completely private and secure.

- ### Self-Destruction

  The files and messages sent via Yopass have a fixed lifetime and will automatically self-destruct after expiration. This ensures that sensitive data is erased, preventing unauthorized access.

- ### Simple Sharing

  With Yopass, sharing encrypted files is simple. A unique, one-click link is generated for each message or file, making it easy to share securely. Alternatively, you can send the decryption password separately for added security.

- ### One-Time Downloads

  To prevent unauthorized access, files shared via Yopass can only be downloaded once. After a successful download, the link becomes inactive, ensuring that the data is not accessed again.

- ### Open-Source Transparency

  Yopass is built using open-source software, which ensures complete transparency. Users can audit the code and contribute to the development, enhancing trust and security.

- ### Cross-Platform Compatibility

  Yopass works seamlessly across all major browsers and platforms. Whether you're using a desktop or mobile device, you can easily encrypt, share, and access your messages and files securely.
