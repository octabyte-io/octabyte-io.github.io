## Overview

Pixelfed is a decentralized, open-source social network for image sharing, offering a unique alternative to centralized platforms like Instagram. Built on the ActivityPub protocol, Pixelfed enables peer-to-peer interactions, allowing users to maintain full control over their data. With an easy-to-use interface and features like albums, threaded comments, and private messages, Pixelfed provides a rich and privacy-focused social media experience. The platform empowers users to connect, share, and communicate in a decentralized manner, ensuring a safe and transparent environment for all.

## Features

- ### Decentralized

  Pixelfed operates on the ActivityPub protocol, which facilitates decentralized, peer-to-peer interactions. Unlike centralized platforms, Pixelfed ensures that your data remains private and secure.

- ### Albums

  Share multiple images in a single post by creating albums, making it easier to organize and present your photos in a cohesive collection.

- ### Comments

  Engage with your audience through threaded comments. Pixelfed allows for interactive discussions, letting users express their opinions and thoughts under each image.

- ### Direct Messages

  Communicate privately with other users through direct messages (DMs). Engage in one-on-one conversations with full control over your privacy.

- ### Filters

  Pixelfed offers a range of photo filters, allowing users to enhance their images before sharing them. Customize your photos to make them stand out in the feed.

- ### Likes & Stories

  Pixelfed incorporates features like likes and stories, enabling users to interact with posts and share ephemeral content that disappears after 24 hours.
