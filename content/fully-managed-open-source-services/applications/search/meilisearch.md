## Overview

Meilisearch is an open-source, ultra-fast search engine designed to provide hyper-relevant search results with minimal latency. Whether you are building an application or a website, Meilisearch is the perfect solution for adding intelligent search functionality. It is scalable, maintainable, and highly customizable, offering an extensive range of tools that allow developers to fine-tune their search engine to fit specific needs. Meilisearch stands out for its blazing-fast response times (less than 50ms) and real-time search updates, delivering exceptional user experience. Ideal for both simple and complex search scenarios, it also features robust typo tolerance and flexible language support.

## Features

- ### Search as You Type

  Meilisearch is optimized for real-time responses, allowing users to see results as they type. With a response time of under 50ms, users can narrow down their search terms or stop searching early once they find what they need.

- ### Typo-Tolerant Search

  Meilisearch provides a natural query language experience, allowing users to search even with typos or misspelled words. This enhances the search experience by handling common errors automatically.

- ### Context-Aware Search

  Unlike traditional search engines that rely on exact keyword matches, Meilisearch allows words to be associated, enabling smarter and more intuitive search results based on context rather than rigid word matching.

- ### Multilingual Support

  Meilisearch supports a wide range of languages, including Latin-based languages, English, and Kanji. With more language support coming soon, itâ€™s a flexible solution for global applications.

- ### Customizable Search Indexes

  Developers can customize Meilisearch indexes to tailor the search engine to specific use cases. This makes it adaptable to various needs, whether for a small application or a large-scale website.

- ### Easy to Install and Maintain

  Meilisearch is designed for easy installation and ongoing maintenance. Its simple setup process allows developers to quickly integrate search functionality, while its scalability ensures it can handle increasing demands over time.
