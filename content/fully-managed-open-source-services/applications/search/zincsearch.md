## Overview

ZincSearch is a high-performance, open-source search engine that enables full-text indexing with significantly lower resource consumption than traditional search engines like Elasticsearch. Built on top of the Bluge indexing library, ZincSearch provides a lightweight yet powerful solution for businesses and developers looking to implement advanced search capabilities in their applications without the overhead associated with more complex search engines.

With its full compatibility with Elasticsearch APIs, ZincSearch allows seamless data ingestion through both single-record and bulk API methods, making it easy to integrate into existing systems. It operates schema-less, so users do not need to define schemas upfront, allowing for flexible data storage and retrieval. Additionally, ZincSearch supports aggregation and highlighting, which enhances search accuracy and user experience.

Whether youâ€™re building a simple search feature or a complex search infrastructure, ZincSearch provides the scalability and speed you need, while keeping resource usage to a minimum.
