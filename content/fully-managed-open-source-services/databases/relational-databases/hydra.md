## Overview

Hydra is an innovative open-source data warehouse built on the robust foundation of PostgreSQL. Designed to handle the most demanding online analytical processing (OLAP) and hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) workloads, Hydra combines cutting-edge features like columnar storage, vectorized execution, and parallel query processing. Unlike traditional data warehouses, Hydra also supports PostgreSQL heap tables, indexing, and native partitioning, delivering exceptional performance for high-throughput transactional writes, quick lookups, and operational queries.

Hydra simplifies modern data stack setup, empowering teams to unify data silos and provide consistent, real-time insights. With seamless integration through PostgreSQL COPY and ETL tools like Airbyte or Fivetran, Hydra ensures your data is always accessible. Its unique external table support enables instant querying and updating of external data sources, making Hydra the go-to solution for teams seeking a unified, high-performance data platform.
