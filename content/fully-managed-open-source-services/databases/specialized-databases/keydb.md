## Overview

KeyDB is a fully open-source, high-performance database that serves as a faster alternative to Redis. Built to handle heavy workloads with ease, KeyDB leverages multithreaded architecture to outperform Redis on a per-node basis. Capable of benchmarking over 1 million ops/sec on a single node, KeyDB is designed for extreme scalability, low-latency access, and high throughput. By keeping all data in-memory, KeyDB delivers sub-millisecond latencies, making it ideal for applications that demand rapid data access. Whether you're looking to manage large datasets, ensure high availability, or scale your database effortlessly, KeyDB is the perfect solution for performance-driven workloads.

## Features

- ### Variety of Data Structures Supported

  KeyDB supports a wide range of data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams.

- ### Scalable

  KeyDB enables effortless scalability with replica nodes, active-replica nodes, and the ability to partition data across a sharded cluster.

- ### High Throughput

  Designed for high workloads, KeyDB can benchmark over 1 million operations per second on a single node, ensuring top-tier performance for demanding applications.

- ### High Availability

  Simplify your high-availability setup with active-replica nodes that do not require senti

- ### Low Latency

  By keeping all data in memory, KeyDB serves data with sub-millisecond latencies, making it ideal for applications requiring fast data access.

- ### Easy Integration with Redis

  KeyDB is fully compatible with Redis clients and protocols, making it easy to integrate into existing Redis-based systems without disruption.
